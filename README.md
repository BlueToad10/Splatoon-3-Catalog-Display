How to Use Splatoon Central Display:

    Track Round Outcomes:
        Use the "KO," "Win," "Lose," and "DC TKO" buttons to log each round outcome.
        The latest outcome will appear at the top of the list as a button.
        If needed, toggle the outcome by clicking on the button in the list to change it.

	The display will automatically predict the number of rounds and hours needed to reach the Catalog Max for the Season.
	It will also show the points needed and the current Multiplier rate. Use the toggle button to cycle through different Multiplier options as needed.

    Adjust Regular Level, Current Rank, and Catalog Level:
        Use the Up and Down buttons to increase and decrease your Regular Level, Catalog Level, and cycle your Current Rank.

    Change Weapon setup and Gear Abilities:
        Use the drop-lists on the right side of the window to select and display your current Weapon, Sub-Weapon, Special, and Gear Abilities.
        Choose from the available options to keep your loadout up to date and visible.
