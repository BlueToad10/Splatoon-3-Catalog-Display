Track Catalog levels for Splatoon 3, and track the last one hundred rounds to guess the rounds and hours needed to reach level 100.
I usually find wins and losses to be around the same amount in terms of the average chance, but it doesn't change much as to how many rounds you need to get to level 100.

Main Display:
Left click: Level up
Right click: Level down
M: Rotate multiplier between 1.0x 1.2x, and 1.5x
N: Get average of results
P: Toggle between: Using round averages, and using base averages
Q+W+E: Remove all rounds except for the last 10

Turf Rounds Log:
W L D Buttons 1: add Win, Lose, or Disconnect at top of list
W L D Buttons 2: convert a different outcome type in list to chosen outcome, adding to it's value
Wide Button List: Displays last 10 rounds of the list up to 100, each one rotates outcome when clicked

M N P Buttons: Same as Main Display

Scroll button: Toggle the moving backgrounds from updating.
Float: Toggle the display moving up and down.

"Save to File" button: Saves last 100 Rounds to Rounds file.
"Load from File" button: Loads last 100 Rounds from Rounds file. (Overwrites current round stat keeping!)
Rounds file: for adjusting the last hundred rounds in text form. (Newest at the bottom, Oldest at the top, represented by "W, L, D" for Win, Loss, Disconnect.)

Settings file: for adjusting the Points and Multiplier's background colors. (Possibly more in future.)

Not sure the accuracy is perfect, but I usually find 80 hours to be about right for every season, and everything can vary, such is life.
The main display window is made to be green screened. Colors are adjustable in the "settings" file.
I do want to see other peoples Round scores and if this helps reach level 100 in the season catalog, @ Me on socials!
