Track Catalog levels for Splatoon 3, and track the last one hundred rounds to guess the rounds and hours needed to reach level 100.
I usually find wins and losses to be around the same amount in terms of the average chance, but it doesn't change much as to how many rounds you need to get to level 100.

Main Display:
Left click: Level up
Right click: Level down
M: Rotate multiplier between 1.0x 1.2x, and 1.5x
N: Get average of results
P: Toggle between: Using round averages, and using base averages

Turf Rounds Log:
W L D Buttons 1: add Win, Lose, or Disconnect at top of list
W L D Buttons 2: convert a different outcome type in list to chosen outcome, adding to it's value
Wide Button List: Displays last 10 rounds of the list up to 100, each one rotates outcome when clicked

M N P Buttons: Same as Main Display

Not sure the accuracy is perfect, but I usually find 83 hours to be about right for every season, daily bonuses are not counted, and everything can vary, such is life.
The main display window is made to be green screened.
Sorry if it doesn't run well or crashes, it wasn't made for use by others, but I hope it does work and I do want to see other peoples Round scores and if this helps reach level 100 in the season catalog, @ Me on socials!
